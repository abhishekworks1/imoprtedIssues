1. Staging - Set the active scheme as `"SocialCAM Staging"` to run the project in Staging environment
2. Production - Set the active scheme as `"SocialCAM"` to run the project in Production environment

### Architecture

The project uses the default Apple architecture (MVC) along with [Protocol-Oriented approach in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/).

‚ÄúEvent‚Äù Patterns such as Delegation, Callback blocks, Notification Center, Key-Value Observing (KVO) and Signals have been used extensively for components to notify others about things.

### Beta Testing

We are using [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) to download the app for beta testing.

To test beta versions of apps using TestFlight, you‚Äôll need to receive an invitation email from the developer or get access to a public invitation link, and have a device that you can use to test.

**Internal testers** Members of the developer‚Äôs team in App Store Connect can participate as internal testers and will have access to all builds of the app.

**External testers** Anyone can participate as an external tester and will have access to builds that the developer makes available to them. A developer can invite you to test with an invitation email or a public invitation link. An Apple ID is not required. If you are part of the developer‚Äôs team in App Store Connect, you can be added as an external tester if you aren‚Äôt already an internal tester.
