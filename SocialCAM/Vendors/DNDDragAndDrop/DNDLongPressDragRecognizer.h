/**
 A gesture recognizer combining a long press and a pan gesture.
 
 To begin the gesture, the user must long press for a given duration. Then moving the finger updates
 the gesture recognizer until the user lifts the finger again.
 
 This gesture recognizer is useful when working with `UITableView` or `UICollectionView` as the drag source,
 as it allows the user to pan without the gesture being recognized as a drag.
