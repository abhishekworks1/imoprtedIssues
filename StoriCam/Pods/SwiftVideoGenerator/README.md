## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependancy manager for Xcode. You can install it by running the following command in the Terminal:

```
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To use Swift Video Generator in your Xcode project using CocoaPods, add it in the `Podfile`:
```Swift
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!
target '<Your Target Name>' do
pod 'SwiftVideoGenerator'
end
```
### Manually

If you don't want to use a dependency manager, you can integrate SwiftVideoGenerator manually.

Download the following files:

[Video Generator Classes](https://github.com/dev-labs-bg/swift-video-generator/tree/master/SwiftVideoGenerator/Classes)

You need the VideoGenerator.swift and the files in the Error and Extensions folders.

###### Add files to project:
- Open your project in Xcode
- Add the files you downloaded to the Project Navigator. You can create your own folders or keep the files as they are.
- And you're done. You're now ready to make some video magic.

## Usage

If you used Cocoapods to install SwiftVideoGenerator, you need to import the module:
```Swift
import SwiftVideoGenerator
```
For both the **.single** and **.multiple** types of video generation the output video file format is m4v.

#### Create a video from a single audio and image file

```Swift
if let audioURL4 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: Audio4 , withExtension: Mp3Extension) {
  LoadingView.lockView()

  VideoGenerator.current.fileName = SingleMovieFileName
  VideoGenerator.current.maxVideoLengthInSeconds = 8
  VideoGenerator.current.shouldOptimiseImageForVideo = true

  VideoGenerator.current.generate(withImages: [#imageLiteral(resourceName: "image4")], andAudios: [audioURL4], andType: .single, { (progress) in
    print(progress)
  }, success: { (url) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(url)
    self.createAlertView(message: self.FinishedSingleTypeVideoGeneration)
  }, failure: { (error) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(error)
    self.createAlertView(message: error.localizedDescription)
  })
} else {
  self.createAlertView(message: MissingResourceFiles)
}
```
With the generator type **.single** you can create a video from a single pair of audio and an image.

[Exmaple video - single type generation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_VCX_bQMRqPYVprSnQzdERLTkk)

The **scaleWidth** property scales the image to a desired size. Only used in a **.single** type of video.

The **fileName** property sets the output file's name.

The **videoBackgroundColor** property is used when scaling the image. When an image is scaled to a smaller frame then the video's it leaves empty spaces around the image. You can set the background color of that space with the **videoBackgroundColor** property. If you don't specify a **scaleWidth** the image is scaled (keeping the aspect ration) to fill the entire video frame.

The **maxVideoLengthInSeconds** property is used to set the video's maximum length. If the length of the moview exceeds this value, it's cut short at the specified time. (Note that this doesn't scale the audios in order to make them fit into the time.)

The **shouldOptimiseImageForVideo** property is used to optimize the images fed into the generators to a scale best fitted for video based on their orientation.

Set the **videoDurationInSeconds** for generated video without audio.

#### Create a video from multiple image/audio pairs

```Swift
if let audioURL1 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: Audio1, withExtension: Mp3Extension), let audioURL2 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: Audio2, withExtension: Mp3Extension), let audioURL3 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: Audio3, withExtension: Mp3Extension) {
  LoadingView.lockView()

  VideoGenerator.current.fileName = MultipleMovieFileName
  VideoGenerator.current.videoBackgroundColor = .red
  VideoGenerator.current.videoImageWidthForMultipleVideoGeneration = 2000

  VideoGenerator.current.generate(withImages: [#imageLiteral(resourceName: "image1"), #imageLiteral(resourceName: "image2"), #imageLiteral(resourceName: "image3")], andAudios: [audioURL1, audioURL2, audioURL3], andType: .multiple, { (progress) in
    print(progress)
  }, success: { (url) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(url)
    self.createAlertView(message: self.FnishedMultipleVideoGeneration)
  }, failure: { (error) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(error)
    self.createAlertView(message: error.localizedDescription)
  })
} else {
  self.createAlertView(message: MissingAudioFiles)
}
```
With the type **.multiple** you can create a video that combines multiple image/audio pairs. The finished video will queue up multiple videos created by taking one image from the array and it's corresponding index element from the audio array, creating a video from it and then appending it to the finished video.
Then the next pair of audio and image will be made into a video and appended after the first one. This will continue untill all image/audio pairs have been appended. If the image/audio pairs are not the same count, the extra audio(s)/image(s) is not used.

The **fileName** and **videoBackgroundColor** properties are used in the same way as in the **.single** type.

The **videoImageWidthForMultipleVideoGeneration** property is used to set a custom width to which the images will be scaled before they are merged with the audio files and generated as a video. The default value is 800.

#### Create a video from multiple images and a single audio

```Swift
if let audioURL1 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: Audio1, withExtension: Mp3Extension) {
  LoadingView.lockView()

  VideoGenerator.current.fileName = MultipleSingleMovieFileName
  VideoGenerator.current.shouldOptimiseImageForVideo = true

  VideoGenerator.current.generate(withImages: [#imageLiteral(resourceName: "image1"), #imageLiteral(resourceName: "image2"), #imageLiteral(resourceName: "image3"), #imageLiteral(resourceName: "image4")], andAudios: [audioURL1], andType: .singleAudioMultipleImage, { (progress) in
    print(progress)
  }, success: { (url) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(url)
    self.createAlertView(message: self.FnishedMultipleVideoGeneration)
  }, failure: { (error) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(error)
    self.createAlertView(message: error.localizedDescription)
  })
} else {
  self.createAlertView(message: MissingAudioFiles)
}
```
With the type **.singleAudioMultipleImage** you can create a video that combines multiple images and a single audio. The finished video will space out the multiple images along the timeline of the single audio.

[Exmaple video - multiple images/single audio generated video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1THpNWw9gZsEUYqrre8JkmOcFZ4IKsHGd)

#### Merging multiple videos into one

```Swift
if let videoURL1 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: Video1, withExtension: MOVExtension), let videoURL2 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: PortraitVideo, withExtension: Mp4Extension) {
  LoadingView.lockView()
  VideoGenerator.mergeMovies(videoURLs: [videoURL1, videoURL2], andFileName: MergedMovieFileName, success: { (videoURL) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    self.createAlertView(message: self.FinishedMergingVideos)
    print(videoURL)
  }) { (error) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(error)
    self.createAlertView(message: error.localizedDescription)
  }
} else {
  self.createAlertView(message: MissingVideoFiles)
}
```
You can provide URLs both for local resource files as well as those stored on the device (i.e. in the Documents folder).

As of right now the merged video keeps all of the **preferredTransformations** (like mirroring or orientation) of the last provided video asset. More to come in future feature implementations.

#### Reversing a video clip

```Swift
if let videoURL1 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: Video2, withExtension: MovExtension) {
  LoadingView.lockView()
  VideoGenerator.current.reverseVideo(fromVideo: videoURL1, andFileName: ReversedMovieFileName, withSound: false, success: { (videoURL) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    self.createAlertView(message: self.FinishReversingVideo)
    print(videoURL)
  }, failure: { (error) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(error)
    self.createAlertView(message: error.localizedDescription)
  })
} else {
  self.createAlertView(message: self.MissingVideoFiles)
}
```
You need to provide the file's URL and optionally a new name for the reversed video file. The **withSound** property controls the audio behaviour: if **true** the audio is kept and reversed as well.

#### Splitting a video clip

```Swift
if let videoURL1 = Bundle.main.url(forResource: Video1, withExtension: MOVExtension) {
  LoadingView.lockView()

  VideoGenerator.current.fileName = SplitMovieFileName
  VideoGenerator.current.splitVideo(withURL: videoURL1, atStartTime: 10, andEndTime: 40, success: { (url) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(url)
    self.createAlertView(message: self.FinishSplittingVideo)
  }, failure: { (error) in
    LoadingView.unlockView()
    print(error)
    self.createAlertView(message: error.localizedDescription)
  })
} else {
  self.createAlertView(message: self.MissingVideoFiles)
}
```
You need to provide the file's URL and optionally a new name for the split video file. The **atStartTime** and **andEndTime** properties mark the start and end of the time range in seconds.
