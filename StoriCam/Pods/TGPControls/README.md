# Slider with _ticks_ & animated Label (Swift)
TGPControls are drop-in replacement of `UISlider` & `UILabel`, with visual preview in **Interface Builder**, single liner instrumentation, smooth animations, simple API,  powerful customization.  

## What's DiscreteSlider?
![ticksdemo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4073988/5912371/144aaf24-a588-11e4-9a22-42832eb2c235.gif)

`TGPDiscreteSlider`: A slider with discrete steps (i.e. ticks), discrete range, with customizable track, thumb and ticks.
Ideal to select individual steps, star rating, integers, rainbow colors, slices and in general any value that is not a continuum. Just set the number of stops, TGPDiscreteSlider handles the selection and the animations for you.

## What's CamelLabels?
![camellabels2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4073988/5912454/15774398-a589-11e4-8f08-18c9c7b59871.gif)

`TGPCamelLabels`: A set of animated labels (dock effect) representing a selection. Can be used alone or in conjunction with a UIControl.
Ideal to represent steps. *The discrete slider and the camel labels can work in unison.*

## Compatibility
1. Written in **Swift 4**, can be integrated with **Swift** or **Obj-C**
2. `TGPControls` are **AutoLayout**, `IB Designable` and `IB Inspectable` ready
3. Version **5.0.1** and better comes with a **Swift 4** demo application for **iOS 8** and above.  
_**iOS 7** supported in versions 2.1.0 and earlier_
4. Automatic support for both left-to-right and right-to-left languages

## Fully Customizable

Control everything about the slider or its labels, starting with colors, images and fonts, including track and ticks shape, and thumb shadows.
All computations regarding range and sizing and handled automatically.
Use the two classes in tandem to create stunning new controls, which can be resized dynamically, to intergrate beautifully into your application.

Most customization can be done in **Interface Builder** and require **zero coding**.

## How to integrate (iOS 8 and higher)

#### Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=TGPControls)

```
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
target 'TGPControlsDemo' do
pod 'TGPControls'
end
```

#### Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

```
github "SwiftArchitect/TGPControls"
```

---

Besides customization, which you can do entirely under Interface Builder in iOS 8 and later, both `TGPDiscreteSlider` and `TGPCamelLabels` require surprisingly little code to integrate.

### DiscreteSlider

For simplicity, TGPDiscreteSlider does *not* descend from UISlider but from **UIControl**.
It uses a `minimumValue`, a `tickCount` and an `incrementValue` (instead of *minimumValue* and *maximumValue*).
All graphic aspects, such as physical spacing of the ticks or physical width of the track are controlled internally. This makes TGPDiscreteSlider predictable. it is guaranteed to always fit snuggly inside its bounds.

**Single step**: To use DiscreteSlider + CamelLabels in tandem, you need exactly **1 line of code**:
```
discreteSlider.ticksListener = camelLabels
```

![complete](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4073988/5912616/26cf1b0a-a58b-11e4-92f7-f9dbcd53c413.gif)

That's all!  
Through the `TGPControlsTicksProtocol`, the camelLabels listen to _value_ and _size_ changes. You may want to adopt this protocol to handle changes, or use the traditional `UIControl` notifications:

**Advanced Steps (1a)**: *register* to notifications (*just like any UIControl*)
```
discreteSlider.addTarget(self,
action: #selector(valueChanged(_:event:)),
for: .valueChanged)
```
**Advanced Steps (1b)**: *respond* to notification
```
func valueChanged(_ sender: TGPDiscreteSlider, event:UIEvent) {
self.stepper.value = Double(sender.value)
}
```


**tickStyle, trackStyle, thumbStyle Properties:**

| Constant      | Value        |       |
|:--------------|:------------:| ----- |
| `.iOS` | 0 | Gives to any component the iOS appearance: Ticks are invisible, track is blue and gray, thumb is round with a shadow |
| `.rectangular` | 1 | Boxy look with hard edges |
| `.rounded` | 2      | From rounded rectangles to perfects circles, depending on vertical to horizontal ratio |
| `.invisible` | 3 | Surprisingly useful to individually hide ticks, track, or even thumb |

**Other Properties:**

| Listener |       |
|:-----| ----- |
| `ticksListener` | a `TGPControlsTicksProtocol` listener, such as `TGPCamelLabels`, which receives spacing changes notifications. |
| `allTargets` | Inherited from `UIControl`, receives actions for control event |

| Tick |       |
|:-----| ----- |
| `tickStyle` | See style property |
| `tickSize` | absolute dimension |
| `tickCount` | discrete steps, must be 2 or greater |
| `tickTintColor` | takes precedence over the control `tintColor` |
| `tickImage` | a `UIImage`, fits in `tickSize` (†) |
| `ticksDistance` | horizontal spacing _(calculated)_ |

| Track |       |
|:------| ----- |
| `trackStyle` | See style property |
| `trackThickness` | height |
| `trackImage` | a `UIImage`, ignores `trackThickness` (†) |
| `minimumTrackTintColor` | track lower side |
| `maximumTrackTintColor` | track higher side |

| Thumb |       |
|:------| ----- |
| `thumbStyle` | See style property |
| `thumbSize` | absolute size |
| `thumbTintColor` | background |
| `thumbImage` | a`UIImage`, dictates `thumbSize` (†) |
| `thumbShadowRadius` | breaking the _flat design concept_ |
| `thumbShadowOffset` | applied to `thumbShadowRadius`, may affect control bounds |

(†) Introduced in version 4.0.0. Former versions used a resource name as a `string`.

### CamelLabels

Besides font customization, `TGPCamelLabels` only requires a set of labels (supplied as *strings*), and an active index selection.

**Step 1**: *tell* the TGPCamelLabels what to select
_(Refer to **Single step** section above to use DiscreteSlider + CamelLabels in tandem)_
```
camelLabels.value = sender.value
```

*There is no step 2.*
Most of the customization can be done inside **Interface Builder**.

**Properties:**

| Property |       |
|:---------| ----- |
| `tickCount` | **design only** (_preferrably not to be used_): the number of ticks is driven by the number of elements in the `names` array |
| `names` | supplies a new set of labels ; supersedes the `tickCount` property, which will return the number of labels. A typical use may be `camelLabels.names = ["OFF", "ON"]` |
| `ticksListener` | ties a discrete slider to its camel labels. This is your most robust method to not only ensure that the layout of both controls match exactly, but also adjust this spacing when orientation changes. A typical use may be `discreteSlider.ticksListener = camelLabels` |
| `ticksDistance` | _override_ the labels spacing entirely ; **prefer** the `ticksListener` mechanism if it is available to you. A typical use may be `camelLabels.ticksDistance = 15` |
| `value` | which label is emphasized (_selected_) |
| `backgroundColor` | labels become  *tap-through* (**click-through**) when set to `UIColor.clear` ; use TGPCamelLabels *on top of* other UI elements, **even native iOS objects**!(*) |

(*)  _You can tap on the `UISwitch` laid out either under or below the camel labels:_
![uiswitch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4073988/11609813/a3b63526-9b45-11e5-9562-34fc2c9b134d.gif)

| Edges & Animation |       |
|:------------------| ----- |
| `numberOfLiness` | Support for multiple lines labels |
| `offCenter` | **leftmost and righmost labels only**: relative inset expressed as a proportion of individual label width: 0: none, +0.5: nudge in by a half width (fully fit) or -0.5: draw completely outside |
| `insets` | **leftmost and righmost labels only**: absolute inset expressed in pixels |
| `emphasisLayout` | emphasized (_selected_) labels vertical alignment ; `.top`, `.centerY` or `.bottom`. Default is `.top` (‡) |
| `regularLayout` | regular labels vertical alignment ; `.top`, `.centerY` or `.bottom`. Default is `.bottom` (‡) |

(‡) No camel animation will occur when `emphasisLayout` = `regularLayout`, i.e. `.centerY`.

| Emphasized labels |       |
|:------------------| ----- |
| `upFontName` | font |
| `upFontSize` | size |
| `upFontColor` | color |

| Regular labels |       |
|:---------------| ----- |
| `dnFontName` | font |
| `dnFontSize` | size |
| `dnFontColor` | color |
