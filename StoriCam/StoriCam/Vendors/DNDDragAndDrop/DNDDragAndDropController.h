 Return the view to be dragged around the screen for the given drag operation.

 If you would like to animate the entry of the view (e.g. a fade-in) you can do so in this method.
 
 @param operation The drag operation needing the drag view.
 @return A view to be dragged on the screen, or `nil` to cancel the operation.
 
 @discussion If you return the drag source itself, be aware that it is removed from its superview while being dragged around.
             After its dropped (on a target or elsewhere) it won't be added back to the original superview. So if you still
             need the source view after dragging, you need to make sure the view is added to another superview after dropping.
